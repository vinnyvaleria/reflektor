# Reflektor

**Reflektor** is a browser-based pixel-style puzzle game inspired by mirror mechanics. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, players control a character navigating a main grid while a mirrored NPC follows on an inverted grid. The objective is to reach the goal without hitting obstacles on either side.
