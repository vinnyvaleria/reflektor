[ Rough ideas ]

MVP
- (done) Grid mirror maze. Pixel style.
- (done) Two characters will move, but user controls the main.
- (done) Secondary character will mirror the movement of main. 
- (done) To win, must reach the goal X. One level for now.
- Obstacles spawn differently in main grid and secondary grid.
- Obstacles to be limited by numbers per grid. Will need a minimum and maximum amount.
- (done) User help : can only be appied to either main or secondary grid.
    > Hammer (to destroy the wall) x 1
    > Axe (to destroy tree) x 1
- If user wins the game, they can input their name in the ranking board.
- Ranking board to record the time and steps taken.
- (done) Game over if the player hits the obstacles in main or secondary grid.
- (done) Movement can be done with arrow keys on keyboard or on screen.
- (done) WH : Maybe instead of recording steps, use round until user wins
- (done) WH : Create 3 different grids for now (static)
- WH : Utilise handicap with keybind instead of mouse only
- SQ : We can only stick with local leaderboard for now (since globally is not taught yet)
- (done) Jay : Make main grid pops than the other
- (done) SQ : Arrow buttons under main grid 
- SQ : The obstacles need to be collected in the grid itself
- (done) SQ : Make sure to comment out the console log at the end
- WH : The obstacle will work when the player walks towards the obstacle
- (done) WH : fetch the modals once will be okay
- WH : add a different game sound (use open source sounds)
- John : since its Top view, trees, grass etc can be top view, so they look like pokemon red/blue tree and grasses
- John : The movement by the person/NPC can be smoother with transition instead of blinking/jumping
- John : The number of files can be reduced, 4 CSS files, 4 HTML files is kinda interesting, bro is farming files instead of games 

Enhancements
- Can be a 2-player game in the future, but turn-based.
- Difficulty level : beginner (5x5), intermediate (7x7), advanced (9x9), expert (9x9 - more obstacles)
- 2 types of ranking board : shortest steps taken and shortest time taken
- Responsive design
- Light/dark mode
- Animation when the level is won (like confettit or if it is game over)
- Store data on client machine (localStorage): Maybe like local ranking?
- Choose a player on which screen: be the girl or boy
- Create a monster to chase player character so they don't take too long

Graphic needed
- Logo
- Game background
- 2 players face
- Obstacles : wall, tree, tall grass
- Help : hammer, axe, sickle
- Information font (so user can view the game instructions mid game if needed)
- Keyboard arrows

Deliverables
- Project planning deliverable
- GitHub repo deliverable
- Presentation deck (for 5 minutes)
- (Optional) Deployed app link deliverable

What to do 
- Planning process thoughts: User input, Update game state, Render/draw on screen output
- Prepare pseudocode
- Separate game state update and rendering under functions
